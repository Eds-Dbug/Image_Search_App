I'd like to add some information I learned from the book JavaScript the Definitive Guide.

I. this in nested functions

1. if a nested function is invoked as a method, its this value is the object it was invoked on.

2. if a nested function(that is not an arrow function) is invoked as a function, then its this value will be either the global object(non-strict mode) or undefined(strict mode).

And any code in an ES6 module is automatically strict code.

3. arrow functions inherit their this value from the environment in which they are defined.

II. bind() will bind a function to an object. like f.bind(o)


In our case, onFormSubmit is invoked as a function, its this value is undefined. render()  is invoked as a method, its this value is SearchBar . Our solution changes onFormSubmit  to arrow function, so its this value become the environment in which it is defined, which is SearchBar.'
